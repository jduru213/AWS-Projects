# What is a Serverless Web Application?

A serverless web application is a modern approach to building web services where developers focus solely on writing code for specific functions without managing the underlying servers. In this architecture, functions are triggered by events, such as HTTP requests or data changes, and automatically scale based on demand. Cloud providers handle server management, allowing for faster development cycles, cost-effective scaling, and efficient resource utilization. This GitHub project explores the principles of serverless web applications using popular serverless platforms like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions.

## Purpose

The sole purpose of this project is to showcase the development and deployment of a serverless web application using AWS services. By adopting serverless architecture, developers can focus on writing code without the burden of managing servers, leading to increased efficiency and agility in application development.

## Problem Solving

This project addresses challenges associated with traditional server management and infrastructure provisioning. Serverless architecture provides an effective solution for applications with varying workloads, as it can automatically scale based on demand. The goal is to simplify the development process and reduce operational overhead.

## Challenges Faced

During the development of this project, challenges may include configuring AWS resources, ensuring proper integration between Lambda functions and API Gateway, and handling deployment-related issues. Addressing these challenges provides valuable insights into best practices for building serverless applications.

## Benefits & Flaws

### Benefits

- **Cost Efficiency:** Pay only for actual usage, resulting in cost savings.
- **Scalability:** Automatic scaling handles varying workloads seamlessly.
- **Development Focus:** Developers can concentrate on business logic without managing infrastructure.
- **Easy Deployment:** AWS SAM CLI simplifies building, testing, and deploying serverless applications.

### Flaws

- **Cold Start Latency:** Serverless functions may experience a brief delay (cold start) when initially invoked.
- **Resource Limitations:** Serverless platforms impose certain resource limits, understanding of which is crucial.

## Recommendation

If you're an employer thinking about implementing serverless architectures on AWS, I highly recommend looking into this solution. It serves as a practical example of both the benefits and challenges of serverless development. Employers can use this project as a valuable learning resource for their development teams, offering insights into effective testing strategies and CI/CD practices.

## Key Takeaways from the Lab Project
